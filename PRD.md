#### **Data Models**
1. **Users:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `role`, `profile_image`, `status`, `settings`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.  
2. **Workspaces:** `id`, `name`, `description`, `owner_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.  
3. **WorkspaceMemberships:** `id`, `workspace_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.  
4. **Channels:** `id`, `workspace_id`, `name`, `type`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.  
5. **Messages:** `id`, `channel_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `ai_generated`, `attachments`, `timestamp`, `edited_at`.  
6. **AIInteractions:** `id`, `user_id`, `workspace_id`, `channel_id`, `type`, `input_text`, `output_text`, `timestamp`.  

#### **API Endpoints**
1. `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user via Clerk.  
2. `GET /api/workspaces` - Fetch userâ€™s workspaces.  
3. `POST /api/workspaces` - Create a new workspace.  
4. `GET /api/workspaces/:id/channels` - Fetch channels in a workspace.  
5. `POST /api/channels/:id/messages` - Send a message in a channel.  
6. `POST /api/ai/summarize` - Summarize a conversation thread.  

#### **Key Components**
1. **Workspace Dashboard:** Lists channels, users, and quick workspace actions.  
2. **Channel View:** Displays chat history with real-time updates and message input.  
3. **Message Input:** Allows users to send messages and trigger AI tools.
